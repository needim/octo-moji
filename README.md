The Github emoji auto-complete Chrome extension




## Usage

Type colon `:` in any github textarea to activate.   

Type more characters to filter.   

`UP` and `DOWN` arrows navigate.   

`SPACEBAR` to dismiss the menu.   

`TAB`, `ENTER`, or `CLICK` to select.   


## Features

- 100% raw JavaScript (so you won't be including jQuery in every page you render for the 15th time)
- It's only active on github.com domains
- Makes no external network requests
- Updated as new emoji are supported
- Extremely small footprint (only XXX KB of JavaScript minified)
